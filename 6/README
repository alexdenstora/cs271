This is the read me file for this assembler program written by Alexander Sahlstrom for CS271.

The driver program is main.c

To use this assembler ensure that all header and c files are in the same folder directory. There should also be an asm folder containing .asm files. 

Open a new terminal window at the folder containing the c and header files. Use this command to compile the files into .o files:

make main

Ignore the warnings and type this next command to run the program:

./main ./asm/Add.asm

This will produce a new file by the name of Add.asm.hack. This file will contain the binary code translation of Add.asm

Ensure that this program is only run using hack assembly files. You can replace Add in the previous command to assemble any of the other hack assembly files into binary.
